I have analyzed user requirements through comprehensive documentation of venture pipeline processes and translated these into technical specifications. The platform addresses real-world problems in impact investing by providing solutions for GEDSI tracking, venture assessment, and capital facilitation that didn't previously exist in an integrated format.

### GLO5 - Problem solving

**Your reflection:**
I have applied theoretical constructs and critical analysis to solve complex, ill-defined problems in the impact investing domain. The MIV Platform addresses the real-world challenge of managing venture pipelines while ensuring GEDSI compliance and social impact measurement. I developed innovative IT solutions by creating an AI-powered assessment system that automatically analyzes venture readiness and suggests relevant IRIS+ metrics. The platform solves the problem of fragmented venture management by providing a unified system that combines CRM functionality, program operations, and impact measurement. I have tackled ill-defined problems such as how to quantify social impact, how to automate venture assessment, and how to create an intuitive interface for complex financial and social data, developing creative solutions that balance technical feasibility with business requirements.

### GLO6 - Self-management

**Your reflection:**
I have demonstrated strong self-management skills by autonomously driving the development of a complex enterprise platform from concept to implementation. I have applied knowledge and skills to new situations by learning and implementing advanced technologies like Next.js 15, Prisma ORM, and AI integration that were new to me at the project's start. I have shown adaptability by iterating on the platform design based on research findings and technical constraints. I take full responsibility for the quality and completeness of the codebase, documentation, and system architecture. I have engaged in reflective practice by continuously assessing the platform's effectiveness, identifying areas for improvement, and planning future enhancements. My approach to continuing professional development is evidenced by my commitment to staying current with emerging technologies and best practices in enterprise software development.

### GLO7 - Teamwork

**Your reflection:**
While this is an individual project, I have demonstrated teamwork principles by designing the platform to support collaborative workflows and diverse user roles. The system includes role-based access control that supports different team member responsibilities (ADMIN, MANAGER, ANALYST, USER). I have created interfaces that facilitate team collaboration through features like activity logging, shared document management, and real-time notifications. The platform architecture supports team-based venture management with features for assigning ventures to team members, tracking collaborative activities, and maintaining audit trails. I have also considered the needs of diverse stakeholders including venture founders, impact investors, and program managers, ensuring the platform serves as an effective collaboration tool across different user groups.
